# Brittany M. Cook

If it's after mid-January, my age is whatever year it is minus two millennia. Unless you *want* me to be over 2,000 years old, in which case, scratch the subtraction.

She/her. 

I love writing. Probably more than anything else, if we're being honest, but that's not the focus here.

The focus is art.

Do I love art? Yes. If I had to say why, it would be the same reason I write: for me, there is no better way to capture emotions. Mine, another's, those of some convoluted narrative I've made up. Art is expressive of thoughts and feelings in ways even words might not be. Art is a universal language, and I can think of few things as beautiful as the connections it creates between human beings, no matter how disparate they may be. I create art to encapsulate the fleeting, split-second moments that pass us by throughout the day. I want to immortalize thoughts, actions, any unconscious expression of emotion. I want those instances to be *felt*, experienced.

That is my art, and that is what I want to continue creating. That is what I love.
