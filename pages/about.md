# Brittany M. Cook

If it's after mid-January, my age is whatever year it is minus two millennia.

My name (first and middle) is rather French, somehow. I am not French.

I am Cherokee, a legal citizen of the Cherokee Nation, and I'm quite proud of that heritage.

Rather than choosing between two loves to dictate the course of my life, I double-majored in English and art and am pursuing a master's in art history.

I love music. I love cats (dogs, too). I love languages and linguistics. I love cold weather (cold is infinitely better than hot, and I *will* die on that hill). I love flannel shirts. I love reading. I love writing.

I say "pop," not "soda."

I spend all my free time reading. Writing. Drawing. Painting. Studying. Hungering for knowledge, to consume language in all its forms, written or pictorial.

I tend to think a person is what they love. They are what they do. Thus, this is what I love. This is what I do. This is who I am.

# Artist Statement

I love art. If I had to say why, it would be the same reason I write, the reason I am fascinated by humans and their ability to create languages: for me, there is no better way to capture emotions. Mine, another's, those of some convoluted narrative I've made up. Art is expressive of thoughts and feelings in ways even words might not be. Art is a universal language, and I can think of few things as beautiful as the connections it creates between human beings, no matter how disparate they may be.

I create art to encapsulate the fleeting, split-second moments that pass us by throughout the day. I want to immortalize thoughts, actions, any unconscious expression of emotion. I want those instances to be *felt*, experienced. I create pictures to be read and understood, stories captured as clearly as if they were written.

That is my art, and that is what I want to continue creating. That, like everything else, everything that constitutes _me_, is what I love.
